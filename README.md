# GcompLDART
Performes G-computation using longitudinal Dirichlet additive regression trees (L-DART) models as described in "Long-term cognitive effects of an incremental blood pressure intervention in a mortal cohort". Josefsson, Karalija and Daniels, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.00357
# SBART2 
Implements Soft BART with the sparsity-inducing longitudinal Dirichlet (L-Dirichlet) prior as described in "Long-term cognitive effects of an incremental blood pressure intervention in a mortal cohort".
# Threshold Intervention
R code for analyses of the Betula data 
# Sim_study_ITI
